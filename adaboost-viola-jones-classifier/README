Go to the main script ‘main.m’, and locate the function call to ’run.m’ 
Give the paths to the directory in the format shown.  The paths should be given as strings, hence my examples are shown with single quotes wrapping the paths.

After properly specifying the paths, execute that cell and it should perform the whole classification process, printing out only the graph at the end.

** NOTE ** If you want to run the full adapts training, find the flag “WHOLE” in the run.m function and set it to “1”, instead of 0.  The graph of results in contained in “testing-performance.png”, and the 40 weak classifiers are stored in “t_classifiers.txt” so that you don’t have to run the full training algorithm.

If for whatever reason ‘run.m’ doesn’t work and there is no easy fix, you can copy the data directory into the project directory and execute each cell of ‘main.m’ in succession.
