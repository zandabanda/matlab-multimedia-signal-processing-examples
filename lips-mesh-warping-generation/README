Go to the main script ‘main.m’, and locate the function call to ’run.m’ 
Give the paths to the directory in the format shown.  The paths should be given as strings, hence my examples are shown with single quotes wrapping the paths.

After properly specifying the paths, execute that cell and it should perform the whole classification process, printing out only the accuracies at the end.

If for whatever reason ‘run.m’ doesn’t work and there is no easy fix, you can copy the data directory into the project directory and execute each cell of ‘main.m’ in succession.

*** NOTE ***
The image warping takes a long time, but once it finishes and you have “output_imgs”, you can use that output cell of image data to generate the jpegs and the m4v!!

The m4v (audio + video) is provided in the folder under
‘mouthvideo.m4v’
