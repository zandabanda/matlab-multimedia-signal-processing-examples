Go to the main script 'run.m', and execute each section in succession.  

This main script calls the helper functions 'getIMdata.m', 'PCA.m', 'PCA_rand.m', and 'knn_im.m'

The sections are broken up according to each step in the algorithm (reading in data and preprocessing, computing PCA, performing knn)

The final subsections will print out the accuracies of 5nn and 1nn.

**NOTE**
the function 'getIMdata.m' establishes a structure for the current directory using the funciton 'dir'.
I use the field 'bytes' to sift through all the files in the directory to find images between 2900 and 3200 bytes.
If any other files are added to the directory other than what is provided, and they are between 2900 and 3200 bytes, the function will NOT read in the image files.
Please leave the directory as is, and don't change the files in such a way as to change their byte count.
