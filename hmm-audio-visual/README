Go to the main script ‘main.m’, and locate the function call to ’run.m’ 
Give the paths to the directory in the format shown.  The paths should be given as strings, hence my examples are shown with single quotes wrapping the paths.

After properly specifying the paths, execute that cell and it should perform the whole classification process, printing out only the accuracies at the end.

If for whatever reason ‘run.m’ doesn’t work and there is no easy fix, you can copy the data directory into the project directory and execute each cell of ‘main.m’ in succession.

*** NOTE *** It takes a while to run each training/testing section for audio, video, audio_visual, as expected.  If you only want individual accuracies, comment out the function call to ‘test_HMM2’ for whichever modality.  Also, when running ‘test_HMM2’ on the audio data, MATLAB will give warnings that the data is ill-conditioned.  Ignore, it still works, and I can’t figure out how why its doing that, since I’m always passing more than one data frame to ‘ghmmlearn’.
